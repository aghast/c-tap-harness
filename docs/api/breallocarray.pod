=head1 NAME

breallocarray - Checked realloc with overflow protection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <tap/basic.h>

void *B<breallocarray>(void *I<ptr>, size_t I<n>, size_t I<size>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

breallocarray() is a wrapper around realloc() that checks whether the
memory allocation succeed, returning the newly allocated memory on success
and calling sysbail() on failure.  It takes a count and a per-element
size, the same as calloc(), instead of a simple size, and checks
internally for integer overflow when doing the allocation.  It is intended
for use inside TAP test cases where the test case should be aborted if
memory allocation fails, and avoid the need to check each allocation as
it's performed.

This function is inspired by the OpenBSD reallocarray() function, but does
its own range checking rather than relying on a system reallocarray()
function.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

breallocarray() returns a pointer to the reallocated memory (which may or
may not be the same as I<ptr>), the same as the standard realloc()
function.  It will never return NULL; if memory allocation fails, it will
abort the program.

=head1 CAVEATS

breallocarray() will not allocate more than UINT_MAX bytes rather than
SIZE_MAX bytes, since the C TAP Harness library only assumes ISO C89 and
SUSv3 and therefore cannot assume F<stdint.h> exists or that SIZE_MAX is
defined.  This is unlikely to cause issues in practice.  This constraint
will be relaxed when assuming ISO C99 is somewhat safer.
