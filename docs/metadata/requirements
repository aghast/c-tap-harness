C TAP Harness requires a C compiler to build.  Any ISO C89 or later C
compiler on a system supporting the Single UNIX Specification, version 3
(SUSv3) should be sufficient.  This should not be a problem on any modern
system.  The test suite and shell library require a Bourne-compatible
shell.  Outside of the test suite, C TAP Harness has no other
prerequisites or requirements.

C TAP Harness can also be built with a C++ compiler and should be
similarly portable to any recent C++ compiler, although it is only tested
with g++.
