You can build C TAP Harness with the standard commands:

```
    ./configure
    make
```

If you are building from a Git clone, first run `./bootstrap` in the
source directory to generate the build files.  Building outside of the
source directory is also supported, if you wish, by creating an empty
directory and then running configure with the correct relative path.

Pass `--enable-silent-rules` to configure for a quieter build (similar to
the Linux kernel).  Use `make warnings` instead of `make` to build with
full GCC compiler warnings (requires a relatively current version of GCC).

Installing C TAP Harness is not normally done.  Instead, see the section
on using the harness below.
