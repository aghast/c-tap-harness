C TAP Harness comes with a comprehensive test suite, which you can run
after building with:

```
    make check
```

If a test fails, you can run a single test with verbose output via:

```
    tests/runtests -b $(pwd)/tests -s $(pwd)/tests -o <name-of-test>
```

Do this instead of running the test program directly since it will ensure
that necessary environment variables are set up.  You may need to change
the `-s` option argument if you build with a separate build directory from
the source directory.

To run the test suite, you will need Perl plus the Perl module Test::More,
which comes with Perl 5.8 or later.  The following additional Perl modules
will be used by the test suite if present:

* Test::Pod
* Test::Spelling

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
